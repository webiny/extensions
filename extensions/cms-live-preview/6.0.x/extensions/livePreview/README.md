# Overview

This extension consists of:

- **Admin Interface**: a preview pane on the left side of the screen that updates in real-time as you edit content on the right side.
- **Article Model**: a simple content model with a couple of fields

The extension works with a Next.js app which you can clone and host locally.

Clone the app from here: https://github.com/webiny/learn-webiny-nextjs-app/tree/live-preview-ext

Once cloned, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
